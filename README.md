This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

> ðŸ“š **For more detailed information, check out our [Documentation](./documentation/) folder.**

## Quick Overview

This is an e-commerce store application built with Next.js, featuring modern web technologies and best practices for online retail.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js was chosen for this store application for several compelling reasons:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Provides better SEO performance and faster initial page loads, crucial for an e-commerce store
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Enables pre-rendering of product pages for optimal performance
- **API Routes**: Built-in API functionality for handling backend operations without a separate server
- **File-based Routing**: Intuitive routing system that makes navigation structure clear and maintainable
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization with `next/image` for better performance
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript integration for better development experience and type safety
- **Vercel Deployment**: Seamless deployment experience with zero configuration
- **Hot Reloading**: Fast development experience with instant feedback during development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.17 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

cd store
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Local Development

1. Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/(store)/page.tsx`.

### Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
